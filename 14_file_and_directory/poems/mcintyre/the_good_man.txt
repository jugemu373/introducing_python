Cheerful and happy was hit mood,
           He to the poor was kind and good,
           And he oft' times did find them food,
           Also supplies of coal nd wood,
           He never spake a word was rude,
           And cheer'd those did o7er sorrows brood,
           He passed away not understood,
           Because no poet in his lays
           Had penned a sonnet in his praise,
           'Tis sad, but such is world's ways.
